    <h1>Light Field Camera Support</h1>
    <h4>Summary:</h4>
    <p> Our project's goal is provide interactively rendering of image through using 
        Light Field Camera support. To do so, we will provide a GUI to let users change camera aperture or click
        on a pixel to re-focuse at that point.</p>
    <h4>Team: Weiyuan Chen, Shengxian Chen, Yiming wang, ChingYi Leung</h4>
    
    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
    <p></p>
      Our idea of creating a light field camera is trying to filter out the important part of the scene out of the 
      unimportant. The problem that we are attempting to solve is adding the support to this camera so we may be capable
      of view a scene from different perspectives or with different focus point. We try to produce a light field image 
      which is 4d so that we can change the focus point interactively without rendering again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
      <h4>Challenging Problems:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>How do we make each pixel to be a grid which is able to record radiance from different directions?</li>
        <p>Attempt: This is core of the project. Before designing the data structure for the gird, we need to understand how
          rays trace through to lens from camera plan and land on the light field sensor which is a set of microlenses. </p>
        <li>How do we change the focus point based on the user's wishes?</li>
        <p>Attempt: If LFIF supports this, we are good to go. If not, we need to build an interactive GUI to 
          support this feature.
        </p>
        <li>How do we efficiently reveal the effect of different focus point 
          after the scene has already been rendered?</li>
        <p>Attempt: Since we must not render again with different focus points, the girds should have the data to achieve
          this feature very fast. for example, O(N) to traverse each grid to update the sample_buffer after we change the 
          focus.
        </p>
      </ol>

      <h4>Questions:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the existing framework we can use to support the light field renderer?</li>
        <p>Attempt: Extend the project3 ray tracing framework.</p>
        <li>What is the input of the light field renderer?</li>
        <p>Attempt: dae files.</p>
        <li>Since we are creating light field images which are 4d with light field rendering, what kind of format 
          of the images? How do we create those images?
        </li>
        <p>Attempt: Light field image format(LFIF) or only use GUI to support the showcases.</p>
      </ol>
      
    </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Goals & Deliverables</h2>
    <p>
      Goals: Under the support of GUI, we can see the image changes without re-rendering if we change
      the parameters such as the aperture of the camera and the fucus point to the image.
    </p>

    <h3>How do we demo?</h3>
    <p>We have a GUI to render an image. We will present the light field image in the GUI with some change of parameter options on the side
      of the GUI.
    </p>
    <h3><em>Hope to Deliver:</em></h3>
    <p>A GUI light field renderer allows users to focus on different spots of the image dynamically. After rendering, user can
      change the focus point, focal length and aperture to present the changed image very fast.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Image: A fairly high resolution image and a GUI takes in user's input of location that they want to foucs on.
        Also, changing some of the parameters can see the result right away in the GUI.
      </li>
      <li>Interactive Demo: the GUI.</li>
      <li>Quality & Performance: we measure the time to render an image which might takes hours. We expect to take very
        short time (1s to 2s) to reflect the change of the light field image after we change the parameters in the GUI.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><em>Plan To Deliver</em></h3>
    <p>Implment the light field renderer that can produce light field image, and a GUI to present the work. We expect the GUI
      can refocus after we click on a spot of the image.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Image: A fairly high resolution image and a GUI takes in user's input of location that they want to foucs on.</li>
      <li>Interactive Demo: the GUI.</li>
      <li>Quality & Performance: same as hoped</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><em>Baseline:</em></h3>
    <p>We must produce light field images that can see the focus changed after we click on the images.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Image: The light field images.</li>
      <li>Interactive Demo: images and video.</li>
      <li>Quality & Performance: hours to render a light field image.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First Week(~4/15): Design and implmenet data structure and algorithm for the grid within each pixel.</li>
      <li>Second Week(~4/22): Ensure Implement Variable Focal Length (modify light ray computation algorithms for Light Field Camera).</li>
      <li>Third Week(~4/27): Debug and implement GUI to show the result. (Should at least have a working result for mileston check)</li>
      <li>Fourth Week(~5/6): Prepare presentation and final writeup. Try for performance/speed improvements, if possible.</li>
